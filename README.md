## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install omnimorph
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
import torch
from omnimorph import OmniMorph

omni_morph = OmniMorph()

text_data = torch.randint(0, 10000, (10, 50))
vision_data = torch.randn(10, 3, 224, 224)
audio_data = torch.randn(10, 1, 16000)

text_embeddings = omni_morph(text_data)
vision_embeddings = omni_morph(vision_data)
audio_embeddings = omni_morph(audio_data)
```

Check out the [examples](./examples) folder for more detailed usage and code examples.


## Examples

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use OmniMorph with text, image, and audio inputs:

```python
import torch
from omni_morph import OmniMorph

omni_morph = OmniMorph()

text_input = torch.randint(0, 10000, (1, 50))
image_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
audio_input = torch.randn(1, 128, 100)

text_embedding = omni_morph(text_input, user_defined_modality='text')
image_embedding = omni_morph(image_input)
audio_embedding = omni_morph(audio_input)
```

### Custom Modality Detection

You can provide your own modality detection function to handle custom data formats:

```python
def custom_modality_detector(input_data):
    # Add custom logic to detect input data modality
    return "custom_modality"

embedding = omni_morph(custom_input, custom_modality_fn=custom_modality_detector)
```

### User-Defined Modalities

To add a user-defined modality, register the corresponding embedding class and instantiate the embedding:

```python
omni_morph.register_and_instantiate("custom_modality", CustomEmbeddingClass, **kwargs)
```

Then, you can use the custom modality when generating embeddings:

```python
embedding = omni_morph(custom_input, user_defined_modality="custom_modality")
```

### Fusion Techniques

Register a fusion technique to combine embeddings in a specific way:

```python
def custom_fusion(embedding):
    # Add custom logic to fuse the embedding
    return fused_embedding

omni_morph.register_fusion_technique("custom_fusion", custom_fusion)
```

Apply the registered fusion technique when generating embeddings:

```python
fused_embedding = omni_morph(input_data, fusion_technique="custom_fusion")
```
